  <h3>AI for Disabilities</h3>

  <p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is transforming the way people with disabilities interact with the world. It provides tools and systems that remove barriers, promote independence, and improve quality of life.</p>

  <h4>How AI Helps</h4>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Communication:</strong> AI enables real-time speech-to-text and text-to-speech conversion. Predictive typing tools assist people with limited mobility or speech difficulties to communicate more easily.</li>
    <li><strong>Vision:</strong> AI-powered applications can describe images, read text aloud, and recognise faces or objects, helping people with visual impairments navigate daily life.</li>
    <li><strong>Hearing:</strong> Automatic captioning and sign-language recognition systems make spoken information accessible to those who are deaf or hard of hearing.</li>
    <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Smart devices and robotics can assist with movement, route planning, and even control of wheelchairs or prosthetics through AI-driven adaptation.</li>
    <li><strong>Cognitive Support:</strong> AI can simplify complex information, remind users of tasks, and break activities into manageable steps for those with learning or memory challenges.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalisation:</strong> AI learns from user preferences and habits, adjusting interfaces, content, and communication styles to suit individual needs.</li>
  </ul>

  <h4>Why It Matters</h4>

  <p>AI helps to create an inclusive society where everyone can participate fully. It reduces dependence on others and opens opportunities in education, employment, and everyday living. The goal is not to replace human assistance but to provide intelligent tools that support independence and equality.</p>

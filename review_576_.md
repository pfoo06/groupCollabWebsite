i. Interest of Content:
I will split this segment to talk about each webpage

AI Page: Very interesting page, as AI and mainly brainrot has indeed taken the world by storm, and the use of generatiev AI in memes or other places has been subject to much debate

Networks Page: Networks are a revolutionary part of technology that has changed how various companies do their work as wella s changing how humanity communicates with one another, I believe this is a good topic for the page as explaining on a networks structure and purposes is very educational and brings context to how the working world today works

AI Disabilities Page: I feel this page works as a follow up to the first AI page, as moving away from AI in generative art and memes, we get into uses of how AI can atcually benefit people physically. However, this page could have been incorporated into part of the first AI page, as I feel they are intrinsically connected.

ii. Consistency and quality of visual presentation:
The visual presentation in each page is outstanding, we do take notice of the nav bar, which is placed excellently to allow easy browsing through the file.

The use of images and bootstrap to split the page into clear segments is also visible, as the information is easy to consume and makes sense in the way it has been formatted in normally bite sized chunks, a personal favourite is the Networks Page which includes diagrams and brief descriptions to explain too.

However, the AI Disabilities page both lacks images and a clear structure, instead opting for a list that is formatted in a strange way with the bullets on the left yet the texts alignment is centered.

iii. Quality of written presentation:
The page with the most detail is the AI Disabilities Page, which goes into detail on how exactly AI will benefit humanity, the other pages mainly go into what their topic is and how it works, simply stating that it "helps" without giving clear reason, as seen in the AI Page.

There is also an abundance of spelling errors found within these webpages, mainly found in the Networks Page with some minor ones in the AI Disabilities page.

iv. Validity of HTML:
I found no errors in the HTML, in fact, I commend the HTML for achieving things such as a coloured background, excellent formatting especially in the AI page as well as the purposeful use of gifs and images on the Networks page. As well as of course the Navigation bar, which looks quite complex to be made
